            <h1>Welcome to our book club!</h1>
            <p>Our book club intends to create a shared reading experience for a community of readers registered as our members.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project is to encourage home reading experiences.</p>
            <p>We have a wide range of book titles of different genres in our catalogue.</p> 
                <p>Each month, members are assigned their book of choice to read for the month.</p>
               <p> At the end of the month, members grouped by category convene and review the books. </p>
               <p> This way, you get to read hundreds of books without actually reading them! How interesting!</p>
             <p>To join our community or donate a book, please send us an email at <em>monthlybookclub@gmail.com</em></p>
